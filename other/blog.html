            looking at the file sizes for stuff in my gif dump is so cool bc it's all so small. i guess it's expected since a lot of it is 88x31, but like,,
            there's two in there (the genderqueer and trans flags) that are only just over <i>200 bytes</i>, which feels insane to me :P and this entire website only takes up about 900kb atm!!
            granted that's partly because the art page images are hosted on imgur instead of being embedded (they're pretty big images) but still

            so i thought i might as well.<br>
            in other news: holy shit i'm deep in oh hellos brainrot atm. i reached 8k plays recently and i'm aiming for 9000 (which will be #1
            on the chuu leaderboard) by the time i get to my first anniversary on lastfm, which is february 8th. it might not be possible,

            anyway, i've almost finished a cosplay! specifically hcs8!bdubs, with the big red glasses and the moss jumper :] i bought a really nice
            green fleece hoodie and it fits so well, and the glasses arrived today! now all i need to do is finish making a lil cardboard clock :]

            not able to reach out to them and say that he's there, like a one-way mirror. and then the darkness! 
            eight minutes of darkness. his story was cut short, like an abandoned notebook, blank pages left untouched. man.<br>
            how is it that last life makes me so poetic? :P i did this when impulse died too,,
