        <div class="song">
          <h3>leaving london - fin</h3>
          <p>
            this song is all about leaving the real world for a place where everyone is happy and everything is okay.
            impulse was always optimistic about the southlands and that it would stay strong, even after people turned red, so i think it
            fits. also, the lines <i>"this world that we're tied to // wasn't meant to fight you"</i> feels pretty relevant to a lot of last lifers,
            and could relate to how impulse never once became the boogeyman
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="song">
          <h3>cynnydd - sŵnami</h3>
          <p>
            it's my character playlist and i get to choose the obscure welsh songs >:3 the whole thing has the vibe, with lyrics
            about lost chances and pessimism about how people act, but this bit at the end particularly gives me impulse vibes -<br>
            <i>"dwi'n cofio meddwl, cofio meddwl bod dim byd o'i le //
            ond erbyn hyn, erbyn hyn dwi'n meddwl mod i'n difaru //
            er fy mod i //
            dwi'n dal i ddeud, dwi'n dal i ddeud bod pethau'n newid //
            er gwell er gwaeth, dim ond amser sydd yn gallu rheoli //
            be' ddaw ohoni"</i><br>
            english translation:<br>
            <i>"i remember thinking, remember thinking nothing was wrong //
            but by now, by now i think i'm having regrets //
            even though i //
            i still say, i still say things are changing //
            for better or worse, it's only time that can decide //
            what will come of this"</i><br>
            this reminds me a lot of when the southlands fell apart and grian burnt the walls. impulse loved the southlands, and wasn't sure
            if leaving it would be a good decision or not
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="song">
          <h3>notos - the oh hellos</h3>
          <p>
            <i>"and the rush will take you away // like you're caught in the undertow //
            and you will drown in the wake // of the things you lost to the winds of notos"</i>
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="song">
          <h3>guarded - flor</h3>
          <p>
            <i>"tall walls here // towering 'round home now, so guarded // watch as they come crumbling 'round me"</i><br>
            do i have to explain this one? :P the walls of the southlands, crumbling as the alliance falls....

        <div class="song">
          <h3>under the tide - chvrches</h3>
          <p>
            idk i just cry every time i hear <i>"i would go anywhere with you // what a lie"</i> (/exag). it's so good to describe the last life
            alliances - so many people say they'll never leave their alliance, and then they leave. this could specifically be
            about martyn, jimmy, and/or mumbo all betraying the southlands when impulse stayed truly loyal to the southlands and to grian :(

        <div class="song">
          <h3>runaway - half•alive</h3>
          <p>
            this one's a lot more hopeful than a lot of the other songs on this playlist. it's about being yourself, staying true
            to your values, and accepting your flaws, and just overall encapsulates the optimistic vibe i think impulse has in last life :)<br>
            <i>"but i find that everything i am is everything i should be // i don't need to run away"</i>
          </p>

          <h3>upside down - set it off</h3>
          <p>
            this was me desperately trying to get some happy songs in here lmao. it's all about being optimistic even when the world
            isn't going your way, and seeing the good in every situation..... like how impulse was! the example i can think of is when him and grian turned
            red, he said something like "we can work together again now!" despite. yknow. them both being one mistake from death

          <h3>hurt - oliver tree</h3>
          <p>
            oh boy. this one's basically all how i see ll!impulse... so many of the lyrics fit how i see him and how the season played out.
            it also doesn't help that i really relate to this song lmao<br>
            <i>"i tried but i don't think so // maybe it was me who was fucking up // i gave all i could give but // it seems like it never really was enough"<br>
            "i don't see how // my whole life can // change in one week"<br>
            "i'm sorry if i hurt you // i'm sorry if it got that bad // i'm sorry i can't help you // somebody shoulda had your back"</i>

          <h3>last known surroundings - explosions in the sky</h3>
          <p>
            okay it's kinda difficult to describe why instrumental songs fit in here, but i think this one has the vibes. to me it
            really encapsulates the tragedy of impulse's last session, going red, running around with grian, spawning the wither, and then finally
            being shot by scott - aka someone he would've once called an ally, or even a friend. and then the sudden quietness of his outro. :(((

            <i>"i jump off and into your arms // but i can't trust the fall // take my voice, i'm giving it though // i don't feel safe at all"</i> -
            he doesn't know how much he can trust his fellow southlanders, especially after jimmy betrays them, but he still puts his faith in them.
          </p>

        <div class="song">
          <h3>this was a home once - bad suns</h3>
          <p>
            just the whole concept of <i>"this was a home once"</i> fits the southlands so well. it used to be a place of
            friendship and trust, but now it's burnt to the ground and ransacked :((((

          <h3>saint bernard - lincoln</h3>
          <p>
            this one's twofold! firstly, there's an absolutely amazing 3rd life animatic about impulse that uses this song
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFQGYB-7wAk" target="_blank" class="normallink">here!</a>). but also, these lyrics:<br>
            <i>"don't make me a liar, because i swear to god // when i said it, i thought it was true"<br>
            "there's really just one thing that we have in common // neither of us will be missed"</i>

        </div>
        
        <div class="song">
          <h3>twin size mattress - the front bottoms</h3>
          <p>
            man i love this song. and i think so many of the lyrics fit! it's such a tragically optimistic song, yknow?<br>
            <i>"this is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends bodies // 
            when the flood water comes it ain't gonna be clear, it's gonna look like mud // but i will help you swim"<br>
            "this is for the snakes and the people they bite // for the friends i've made, for the sleepless nights // for the warning signs i've completely ignored"<br>
            "i wanna contribute to the chaos // i don't wanna watch and then complain // 'cause i am through finding blame // that is the decision that i have made"</i>

        <div class="song">
          <h3>a narrow escape - beast, please be still</h3>
          <p>
            this song is so perfect for ll!impulse that i wrote a fic about it. it's instrumental, but it's the perfect vibe to describe
            the time in session 6 where he gets attacked by scott - the calm before the storm, the buildup, then the frantic escape. even the name of the song fits!
            he makes a narrow escape, not knowing that it was in vain anyway.

          <h3>spotlight - mutemath</h3>
          <p>
            <i>"just take the fall, you're one of us"</i> - impulse turns red by falling, joining mumbo as a red name. he becomes "one of them".<br>
            <i>"and when you feel the wall cannot be burned // you're gonna die to try what can't be done"</i> - he thinks the southlands are invincible. he thinks their
            bond is too strong to be broken. but then he dies, and the wall burns. poetic cinema

            florescent means to flower as far as i can tell, and obviously they're the *flower* husbands :P and just in general, this is a super

            literally all the lyrics fit them so well. <i>"scaling walls, the walls that took us years to build"</i> obviously evokes the walls built
            around the flower forest, but there's also <i>"but heartache pales in comparison to love"</i> which is just so tender, and makes me think of the
            concept that the time spent together was worth the pain that came with jimmy's death.

            this song was originally just by jukebox the ghost, but i've always thought that this version's super underrated :P<br>
            <i>"i think that i would like to invite everyone i've known, dead and alive // to a street where we can be totally free // they will come in droves //
            wearing their hearts on their sleeve, but oh! // how good it felt to have them worn just like they should"</i><br>
            scott and jimmy never wanted to fight. they just wanted to have a life together in the flower forest, having fun with their friends. this line
            to me is their want for everyone to put aside the fighting

            <i>"looking into your eyes // endlessly // falling into your lap // desperately"</i><br>
            <i>"you're clawing at the corner of my heart, i // can't afford to lose you any longer // holding you like hot tea"</i> - this line specifically

            i see this as scott talking about jimmy. jimmy's very outspoken yet shy and mildly awkward sometimes, but scott's always been kinda of stoic when it comes
            to his true feelings<br>

            this is a song about knowing your relationship is doomed from the start, but still carrying on regardless. (in the context of the album
            it's about an abusive relationship, but in this context i'm interpreting it as just doomed love in general)<br>
            <i>"i am not a fool entire // no, i know what's coming // you'll bury me beneath the trees i climbed when i was a child // i know i shouldn't love you // but i do"</i><br>

            this song sounds happy, but is actually about a love that shouldn't exist.<br>
            <i>"all i want is you // your violet disposition // my unsound intuition"</i><br>
            <i>"our end is coming soon // but one more time i'll forget with you"</i> - they both know their love can't last forever in a world like 3rd life,
            but they keep trying anyway. they're destined to leave each other.

            there's a few general things about this rather than specific lyrics. it's a love song, it has so many nature motifs (which connects to the
            *flower* husbands pretty well), etc. i think it conveys scott choosing to live on and avenge jimmy, and it could also be seen as something
            to do with the after (either jimmy waiting for scott or scott waking up there)

            from if to when....... crying /pos<br>
            in general this song (especially the last section) really makes me think of that one richard siken quote, <i>"someone has to leave first.
            this is a very old story. there is no other version of this story."</i> :(

          <h3>flightless bird, american mouth - iron & wine</h3>
          <p>
            i'm gonna be honest, a lot of this is because i very heavily associate this song with the end scene of the first twilight
            film, aka the best love scene in any film i've seen :P<br>
            <i>"have i found you? // flightless bird, jealous, weeping // or lost you?"</i> - the two "kindred spirits" (as the prophecy book in empires
            calls them) have found each other, only to be ripped away and lost when jimmy dies.

            a disclaimer - this is my favourite song ever, and i try to work it into playlists wherever i can :P<br>
            imo this song is one of the best love songs ever, despite not having any lyrics. it perfectly encapsulates how love feels (at least to me), 
            so it's perfect for this playlist :]
