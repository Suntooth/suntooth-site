Ingredients
    Ground turkey meat, approx. 1.5 to 2 lbs.
    Crushed or minced garlic, about half a dozen cloves (one or two heaping tablespoons)
    Parsley, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup
    "Italian seasoning" (oregano, etc.), one or two tablespoons
    One large onion (or two small to medium onions), chopped or diced
    One small can of diced green chilies (or one "soup can" of diced tomatoes and green chilies), with liquid
    Spaghetti sauce, about 2 to 3 cups
    Gravy mix, prepared slightly thick, about 2 to 3 cups
    One small can of sliced water chestnuts, drained
    One small can or jar of sliced mushrooms, drained 

Instructions
    In a Dutch oven, using "high" heat, brown the ground turkey. Drain the fat.
    Add the garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, and onion. Mix well. Be wary of scorching.
    Add the chilies (and tomatoes). Mix well. Let simmer on "high" for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    Add the spaghetti sauce and the gravy mix. Mix well. Turn the heat down to "medium". Let simmer for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    Add the water chestnuts and the mushrooms. Let simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently (the mushrooms tend to stick to the bottom of the pot, causing the hash to scorch, giving it a "burned" taste).
    Serve over spaghetti (or other pasta), rice, toasted slices of French or Italian bread, etc. 

Notes
It has been my experience that this hash actually tastes better the next night. It "ages" well overnight in the refrigerator. I've never frozen any of it (leftovers don't go uneaten in our house), so I don't know how well it handles being frozen and thawed. However, it is quite suitably for being prepared a day in advance.
