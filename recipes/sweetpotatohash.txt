A sweet and spicy vegetarian hash perfect for any time of day. This recipe is incredibly forgiving. I never really measure it; instead I just taste as I go. It's always great.
Makes 1 large serving.


Ingredients

- 1 Sweet Potato
- 1 Small Red or Orange Bell Pepper
- 1/4 Red Onion or 1/2 Shallot
- 1/2 Tomato (optional)
- 1 Garlic Clove
- Olive Oil (enough to oil the pan)
- Soy Chorizo (optional, to taste)
- 1 Egg (optional)
- Cheese (Pepper-jack is preferred)
- 1/2 tsp. Smoked Paprika
- 1/8 tsp. Cayenne Pepper Powder (if you want it spicy)
- 1 pinch Kosher Salt
- Freshly Cracked Black Pepper
- Sour Cream or Mayonnaise
- 1/2 Small Avocado
- 10" Cast Iron Pan preferred


Method

- Cut the potato into roughly 1 inch cubes or thinner. Finely chop the onion or shallot. Cut the bell pepper into strips then into squares roughly the same size as the sweet potato chunks. Finely chop the tomato and garlic.
- Oil your preheated pan and add the onion (or shallot) and garlic. Sweat for about a minute or until translucent over medium heat.
- Add the potato, bell pepper, and tomato. Season with Kosher Salt, Cayenne and Smoked Paprika.
- Cover and let steam for 5-10 minutes. If you didn't add tomato, add 2 teaspoons of water after 5 minutes to generate steam. Keep covered. Check potato for softness. You may need to reduce the heat, but you still want the potatoes to brown.
- If you're adding eggs or soy chorizo, add them once the potatoes begin to go soft but still put up resistance. If not, skip to the second-to-last step.
- Add the soy chorizo first, stir it in and let it cook for 1 minute.
- Make a well in the center of the pan moving.
- Add the egg to the well.
- Cover and let cook for about a minute before adding a bit of water and covering to steam the top of the egg.
- Once potatoes and peppers are soft and starting to brown add more salt and pepper to taste.
- Add to bowl, top with cheese and sour cream.
