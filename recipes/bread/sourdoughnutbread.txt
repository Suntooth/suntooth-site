Basically the Universal Bread Recipe with sourdough and nuts.

  250g of Lidl's finest strong white bread flour (11% gluten)
  250g of Marks and Spencer's Wholemeal bread flour (brown bag, 350g water to 500g flour)
  Half tsp salt, two flat tbsp of mixed seeds, caraway seeds, rosemary seeds, shake of ground cinnamon, about 15g of pecan nuts roughly chopped
  325g water with 2 tbsp of active sourdough added along with tsp honey

Mix dry ingredients then add the water/sourdough/honey and mix to a rough dough. Leave to rest for half an hour. Knead for 10 min or so (can be rippy). Knead with wet hands/more water as the wholemeal can absorb more.

Rise overnight. Shape as 'Spanish country loaf': pull out to about 16 inches then fold in three and repeat four times. Place on oven tray lined with baking parchment and allow to rise for one to two hours. Slash three or four times, shake salt and sprinkle cold water on top. Then bake for half an hour in a pre-heated (225 deg min) oven. Turn over to firm up the base and bake for a further 10 minutes. Turn out onto rack and allow to cool.
