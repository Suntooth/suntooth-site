Source: unknown. I assume someone told me it once online, but I have no idea.

DISCLAIMER: I never actually labelled what this recipe makes in my notes and I'm having a hard time visualising what the steps of the recipe are doing, so they might be quesadillas or they might be something like pizza wraps. I genuinely don't know.

Prep:
- Preheat your oven to 350° F (Or any temperature, I don't care enough to remember what I usually set it to.)
- Dice one or two regular peppers (whichever colors are preferred).
- Dice up 1 jalapeño finely

Assembly
- Spread cream cheese onto as many wraps as desired (Flavored wraps like tomato, cheese, spinach also work). Make sure to cover all edges of the wraps. The layer should be as thin as possible, but a thicker layer will give a more pronounced cream-cheese flavor.
- Add a layer of grated cheddar cheese onto the wrap, as if you were making a Pizza.
- Add peppers and jalapeños on top of the cheese, once again as if you were making a pizza
- Wrap the wraps up as tightly as you can.
- Chop 1 inch off of the edges. These will not cook well, so you can eat them or give them to someone who will eat them.
- Chop the rest of the wraps into half-inch sections like sushi.

Cooking
- Place the wraps onto a baking tray with parchment paper. Place the slices down on the tray so the edges don't touch.
- Put the trays in the middle rack of the oven. Let them cook for 10 minutes.
- Flip them over, and let them cook for another 10 minutes.

Done!
